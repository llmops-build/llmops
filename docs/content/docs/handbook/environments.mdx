Environments represent deployment stages where your LLM configurations run. Common examples include production, staging, and development.

## Overview

Each environment:

- Has a unique name
- Contains one secret for API authentication that can be rotated.
- Can serve different variant configurations than other environments

This allows you to safely test new model configurations in staging before promoting them to production.

## Creating an Environment

Navigate to the **Environments** section in the LLMOps dashboard to create a new environment.

Give your environment a unique name (e.g., "Production", "Staging", "Development").

## Environment Secrets

Each environment has associated **secrets** that authenticate API requests. Think of them as API keys for that specific environment.

When making an API request, pass the environment secret as the `apiKey` in your OpenAI client configuration. This is sent via the standard `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` header:

```typescript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000/llmops/api/genai/v1',
  apiKey: 'your-environment-secret', // Environment secret goes here
  defaultHeaders: {
    'x-llmops-config': 'your-config-id',
  },
});

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }],
  model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
});
```

Or with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/llmops/api/genai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-environment-secret" \
  -H "x-llmops-config: your-config-id" \
  -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]}'
```

## Example Setup

A typical setup might include:

| Environment     | Purpose                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Production**  | Stable, tested configurations for end users |
| **Staging**     | Pre-release testing before production       |
| **Development** | Experimental configurations for developers  |

Each environment can serve different [variants](/docs/handbook/variants) of the same [config](/docs/handbook/configs), allowing you to test changes safely before they reach production.
