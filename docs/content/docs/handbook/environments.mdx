Environments represent deployment stages where your LLM configurations run. Common examples include production, staging, and development.

## Overview

Each environment:

- Has a unique name
- Contains one secret for API authentication that can be rotated.
- Can serve different variant configurations than other environments

This allows you to safely test new model configurations in staging before promoting them to production.

## Creating an Environment

Navigate to the **Environments** section in the LLMOps dashboard to create a new environment.

Give your environment a unique name (e.g., "Production", "Staging", "Development").

## Environment Secrets

Each environment has associated **secrets** that authenticate API requests. Think of them as API keys for that specific environment.

When making an API request, include the environment secret in the `x-llmops-environment` header:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/llmops/api/genai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-llmops-config: your-config-id" \
  -H "x-llmops-environment: your-environment-secret" \
  -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]}'
```

## Production Environment

One environment is marked as the **production** environment. This is the default environment used when no `x-llmops-environment` header is provided.

This allows client-side applications to make requests without exposing environment secrets, while still routing to the correct configuration.

## Example Setup

A typical setup might include:

| Environment     | Purpose                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Production**  | Stable, tested configurations for end users |
| **Staging**     | Pre-release testing before production       |
| **Development** | Experimental configurations for developers  |

Each environment can serve different [variants](/docs/handbook/variants) of the same [config](/docs/handbook/configs), allowing you to test changes safely before they reach production.
